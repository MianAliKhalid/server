🌟 Project Description
This is a production-grade Node.js/Express backend that implements secure file uploads, JWT authentication, and role-based access control. It integrates Cloudinary for optimized image management, uses MongoDB for data persistence, and leverages a clean and scalable architecture.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
JWT tokens for stateless authentication, ensuring secure access to the app (JWT Documentation).
Zod schema validation for runtime type safety in request handling (Zod Docs).
Multer middleware for handling multipart form-data, such as image uploads (Multer GitHub).
Express error handling middleware for consistent error messages and status codes (Express Error Handling).
MongoDB aggregation pipelines for efficient and complex data retrieval (MongoDB Aggregation).
📚 Key Dependencies
🖼️ Cloudinary – Image optimization and delivery.
🗄️ Mongoose – MongoDB ODM with TypeScript support.
🛡️ Express-rate-limit – Rate limiting for API requests.
🔒 Helmet – Security headers to protect the app from common vulnerabilities.
🌐 CORS – CORS middleware to handle cross-origin requests.

🔍 Key Directories
middleware/ - Contains custom authentication, validation, and error handling middleware.
models/ - Mongoose schemas and database models for data management.
services/ - Isolated business logic, separate from route handlers to ensure maintainability.
types/ - Shared TypeScript interfaces and types to enforce type safety across the project.
